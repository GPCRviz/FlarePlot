# FlarePlots

FlarePlots illustrate contacts between grouped nodes and are useful for exploring interaction graphs. They have a time-slider to illustrate the evolution of dynamically changing networks and circular layers of color-coded annotations around the edge of the diagram.

A FlarePlot takes a JSON file as input (description of the format and scripts for automatically generating them can be found [here](https://github.com/GPCRviz/FlarePlot/tree/master/input)). This file can either be uploaded to our page ([here](https://GPCRviz.github.io/FlarePlot)) or embedded in your own page (directions are found [here](https://github.com/GPCRviz/FlarePlot/tree/master/embedding)).
