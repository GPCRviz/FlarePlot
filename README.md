# FlarePlots

FlarePlots illustrate contacts between grouped nodes and are useful for exploring interaction graphs. They have a time-slider to illustrate the evolution of dynamically changing networks and circular layers of color-coded annotations around the edge of the diagram.

* A FlarePlot takes a JSON file as input (description of the format and scripts for automatically generating them can be found in the [input](https://github.com/GPCRviz/FlarePlot/tree/master/input) folder). 
* This file can either be uploaded and visualized at our page ([GPCRviz.github.io/flareplot](https://GPCRviz.github.io/flareplot)) or embedded in your own page (directions are found in the [embedding](https://github.com/GPCRviz/flareplot/tree/master/embedding) folder).
